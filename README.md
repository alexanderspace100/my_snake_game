## Play
the game [here](https://alexanderspace100.github.io/my_snake_game/) using arrow keys to control the Snake.

##This game
is inspired by a Coding Challenge by Daniel Shiffman. The game is complete and the code here is different than Shiffman's code.

##Note
This game doesn't have a pause button, so...no pee breaks :)
